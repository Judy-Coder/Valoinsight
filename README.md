Simple static site to visualise VALORANT match KPI scores. KPI items are hard-coded and scores can be entered manually. The page displays the average score of the entered KPIs. The evaluation and summary notes can also be exported as a JSON file via the **エクスポート** button in the fixed footer.

## Usage

Open `index.html` in your browser. Enter scores for each KPI. The average score will update automatically as scores are entered.
